FlatOut Ultimate Carnage Music Tool
=====================
This is my little tool, I've came up with when screwing around with Flatout Ultimate Carnage.

Its point was to make it easy to extract music from Flatout 1 and Flatout 2 and import it Ultimate Carnage (which for me has noticeably more annoying soundtrack than first 2 games).

The tool was tested only with Steam versions of Flatout games (installed in default Steam directory), but some effort was made to make it work with other versions of the game. It also contains a playlist editor, to make it easier to choose which tracks to play.

**NOTE** - I don't not take any responsibility if the tool damages your game or worse removes/overrides files on your computer (it really shouldn't, but don't sue me if it happen - still, make sure to contact me on GitHub issues page, so I can fix it).
