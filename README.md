FlatOut Ultimate Carnage Music Tool
=====================
This is my little tool, I've came up with when screwing around with Flatout Ultimate Carnage.

Its point was to make it easy to extract music from Flatout 1 and Flatout 2 and import it Ultimate Carnage (which for me has noticeably more annoying soundtrack than first 2 games).

For now the tool works only with Steam version of the game (and only if it's installed in the default Steamapps folder). The tool also contains a playlist editor, to make it easier to choose which tracks to play.

**NOTE** - I don't not take any responsibility if the tool damages your game or worse removes/overrides files on your computer (it really shouldn't, but don't sue me if it happen - still, make sure to contact me on GitHub issues page, so I can fix it).
